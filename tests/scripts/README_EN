The script run.sh executes the tests for every solver and with the collected data
creates a graph stored at resultado.eps.
By default the script gets the data from ../data and stores the result at ../results
this can be changed editing the generator scripts.
If the binaries of the solvers aren't in the path every generator script must be
edited to add the binaries' path
